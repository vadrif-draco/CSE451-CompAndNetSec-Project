# CSE451-CompAndNetSec-Project
This is the project for the CSE451 Computer and Networks Security course in the Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University. In this project, we implement secure file transfer over FTP.

# Demo
Here's a quick demo for a full run of uploading and encrypting a file on the FTP server backend and requesting, downloading, and decrypting it on the client.
